COMPENG 2DX3: 3D LiDAR-Scanner 

A ToF sensor, a stepper motor, a TI MSP432E401Y microcontroller and a single external push button were all utilized by the LiDAR Scanner. The system successfully used 
I2C to transfer distance measurements from the ToF to the board, and UART was used to transmit the data to an external PC. After that, Python was used to plot and display
the distance data.
